# Business-Analytics-Model-Development: Customer Churn

# Overview:
This repository contains code and documentation for developing a business analytics model focused on predicting customer churn. The model analyzes customer data to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers

# Features:
* Data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality.
* Model development for predicting customer churn - Linear Regression. 
* Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics - Mean Squared Error(mse) and R-squared were used as 
  relevant metrics
* Organized and documented Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and replication.

# Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

# Installation:
* Clone the repository: https://github.com/PAUL-byte-spec/Business-Analytics-Model-Development-for-Customer-Churn.git
  
# Step by step plan for developing the model
# Data Preprocessing:
•	Load the dataset.
•	Review the dataset to understand its structure, features, and target variable.
•	Handle missing values: Identify any missing values and decide on a strategy to handle them (e.g., imputation or removal).
•	Handle duplicates: Check for duplicate rows and decide whether to remove them.
•	Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).

# Model Development:
•	Linear regression was selected as an appropriate model for the business analytics task 
•	Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.
•	Train the model on the training data.

# Model Training:
•	Fit the model to the training data.
•	Monitor the training process to ensure convergence and avoid overfitting

# Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error and R-squared).
•	Visualize the model's predictions and compare them with the actual values.
•	Interpret the model's coefficients or feature importance to gain insights into the underlying relationships.

# Model Optimization:
•	Experiment with different models or algorithms to improve performance.
•	Fine-tune hyperparameters based on performance metrics and domain knowledge.
•	Consider ensemble techniques or advanced models for better performance.


# Usage:
* Review and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
* Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
* Follow the step-by-step plan outlined in the notebook for developing the model.
* Run the code cells to execute the analysis and train the model.
* Evaluate the model's performance using the provided metrics.
* Customize the notebook as needed for specific requirements or datasets.

# Customization:
The Jupyter Notebook can be customized according to specific business needs or datasets. Some possible customizations include:

* Modifying data preprocessing steps to handle different types of data.
* Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms for model training.
* Adjusting evaluation metrics based on business priorities and goals.
* Adding additional visualizations or insights to enhance the analysis.
