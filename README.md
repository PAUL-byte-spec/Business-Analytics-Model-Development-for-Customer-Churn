# Overview:
This repository contains code and documentation for developing a business analytics model focused on predicting customer churn. The model analyzes customer data to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers

# Features:
* Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
* Model development for predicting customer churn.
* Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.
* Organized and documented Jupyter Notebooks for easy understanding and replication.

# Requirements:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

# Installation:
* Clone the repository: https://github.com/PAUL-byte-spec/Business-Analytics-Model-Development-for-Customer-Churn.git

# Usage:
* Review and clean the dataset to prepare it for analysis.
* Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository.
* Follow the step-by-step plan outlined in the notebook for developing the model.
* Run the code cells to execute the analysis and train the model.
* Evaluate the model's performance using the provided metrics.
* Customize the notebook as needed for specific requirements or datasets.

# Customization:
The Jupyter Notebook can be customized according to specific business needs or datasets. Some possible customizations include:

* Modifying data preprocessing steps to handle different types of data.
